# Machine Learning Systems for Sleep Quality Assessment Based on EEG Signals

This repository is part of my master thesis and focuses on analyzing multiple **machine learning** and **deep learning** models for predicting **sleep quality** using EEG signals extracted from **EDF (European Data Format)** files.

The project covers the full pipeline:  
**data acquisition → preprocessing → cleaning → segmentation → modeling → evaluation**.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **Sleep-EDFX Database** provided by PhysioNet:

👉 [Sleep-EDFX Database (PhysioNet)](https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/)

The dataset contains overnight polysomnography (PSG) recordings and hypnograms for both healthy subjects (SC) and individuals with insomnia (ST).

## 📓 Notebooks Overview

All notebooks in this repository are numbered in the order they were created.

### 🔧 **Important**
The **first three notebooks must be executed in order**, as they contain the full ETL pipeline:

1. **Download** the raw Sleep-EDFX dataset  
2. **Visualize** and inspect the signals  
3. **Clean, validate, and preprocess** the EDF files  

Once these steps complete successfully, **you do NOT need to rerun them**.

### 📌 Remaining notebooks
All other notebooks can be executed **independently**, as they operate on the processed dataset.

## 📁 Required Files for ML/AI Experiments

To train or evaluate any machine learning or deep learning model, you must have the following folder generated by the ETL pipeline:

```
process_dataset/
│
├── train/
├── val/
├── test/
└── class_distribution.csv
```

### Contents:
- **197 `.npz` files** (preprocessed 30‑second EEG epochs)
- **train / val / test** split (stratified by SC/ST subjects)
- **class_distribution.csv** summarizing the global sleep-stage distribution  
✔ a “How to Run” section  
✔ model results tables  
✔ citations section  

Just tell me what you'd like to include.
